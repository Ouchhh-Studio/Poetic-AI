# Poetic-AI

As Ouchhh, we have created a solo exhibition called “POETIC AI”  at Atelier des Lumières, Paris. It's an exhibition which will last for 6 months. It utilizes 50K pixels and in total 136 projectors. It is worlds largest AI related exhibition and so far it had more than 100.000 visitors in 4 weeks.

Basically, by using ML and AI algorithms, we tried to create an A.I which were meant to learn from millions of lines of theory, articles and books about light, physics, space-time that is written by scientists who change the destiny of the world and write history.

It utilizes the use of Recurrent Neural Networks [We used Tensorflow] to generate new and novel text after being trained on hundreds of books and articles [approx. 20 million lines of text] on physics related sciences. We have collected a huge data corpus dating back to Galileo and with topics from Quantum Mechanics to Astronomy. 

Also we have experimented with t-SNE by converting these set of documents to a term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix and then visualizing it in 3D space. You can see what we have created out of t-SNE above on the second link, this was only for visualization purpose.

If you would like to visit the exhibition sometime we would be very glad to welcome you there and hear your thoughts on it.
